Of course, there are different levels of Kufur (disbelief) so although a person may be correctly identified as a kafir, that person is not kafir in the strongest sense of the word. Absolute kufur is the rejection of God. Here are some examples of kufur:\n\n(1) A person is known as a Kafir if they are disbelievers in Allah, in His Oneness, and in His final Messenger, Muhammad (SAW). (E.g. An apostate from Islam)\n(2) A 'Muslim' who disbelieves in a necessary tenant of Islam like the 5 pillars or some other things is known as a disbeliever.\n(3) An originally non-Muslim person who denies the religion of Islam while knowing in his heart that it is true.\n(4) A disbeliever in Islam only because they originally follow another (monotheistic) faith.\n(5) A person who follows another (monotheistic) faith and knows nothing about Islam.\n(6) A person who believes in many gods (polytheist).\n(7) An agnostic who is a monotheist is a lesser kafir than a polytheist.\n(8) An Atheist (mulhid).\n\nGenerally a Christian or Jew is not identified as a kafir but they are known respectfully as Ahlul Kitab - People of the Book(s), and Islam considers their religions valid but once they find Islam they are expected to follow the updated covenant sent by God.","more":"&#1608;&#1614;&#1573;&#1616;&#1584;&#1618; &#1602;&#1615;&#1604;&#1618;&#1606;&#1614;&#1575; &#1604;&#1616;&#1604;&#1618;&#1605;&#1614;&#1604;&#1575;&#1614;&#1574;&#1616;&#1603;&#1614;&#1577;&#1616; &#1575;&#1587;&#1618;&#1580;&#1615;&#1583;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1618; &#1604;&#1570;&#1583;&#1614;&#1605;&#1614; &#1601;&#1614;&#1587;&#1614;&#1580;&#1614;&#1583;&#1615;&#1608;&#1575;&#1618; &#1573;&#1616;&#1604;&#1575;&#1617;&#1614; &#1573;&#1616;&#1576;&#1618;&#1604;&#1616;&#1610;&#1587;&#1614; &#1571;&#1614;&#1576;&#1614;&#1609; &#1608;&#1614;&#1575;&#1587;&#1618;&#1578;&#1614;&#1603;&#1618;&#1576;&#1614;&#1585;&#1614; &#1608;&#1614;&#1603;&#1614;&#1575;&#1606;&#1614; &#1605;&#1616;&#1606;&#1614; &#1575;&#1604;&#1618;&#1603;&#1614;&#1575;&#1601;&#1616;&#1585;&#1616;&#1610;&#1606;&#1614;\n\nAnd behold, We said to the angels: \"Bow down to Adam\" and they bowed down. Not so Iblis: he refused and was haughty: He was of those who reject Faith. [Quran 2.34]\n\nNotice the use of the word 'kafireen' in the Arabic. This is one of the reasons why one must learn Arabic to understand the full meaning of the Quran, the words of Allah. Kafir is derived from the word meaning 'to cover' and Kafir also means 'disbeliever in God'. But in this case, Iblees (Satan) is fully aware of Gods' existence and power yet he is still described as a kafir. This goes to show that a person can be a kafir even if he believes in a God. In other words, just because someone believes there is a God, that someone can still be a kafir and be (technically) condemned to hell. Therefore, a kafir can be more correctly defined as someone who 'rejects submission to God' even though he is fully aware of His existence, as well as meaning a person who is a true Atheist - one who 'rejects the existence of God'."},{"word":"kafireen","audio":"","script":"\u0643\u0627\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0646","grammar":"word; plural; singular=kafir;","meaning":"This plural word means 'unbelievers'.

The Khilafah system ended with the end of the Ottman empire. There can be no more Khalifate until a new Islamic empire is re-born.\n\nThe Khalifate issue is quite controversial as the purpose of leadership was to manage the Muslim Ummah, yet the Prophet (SAW) did not commission a Khalif after him or organise a method of choosing the Khalifah. The Shia Muslims argue otherwise and state that the Prophet (SAW) chose Ali ibn Abi Talib (AS) to be the leader after his departure and his sons after him, as an order by Allah. This did not happen and as you can see in the list above Imam Ali ended up being the fourth khalif. There were five main methods of becoming khalif:\n\n- Election by a small number of elite people\n- Passing of leadership from Khalif to friend\n- Passing of leadership from Khalif to son\/decendant\n- Murder of the khalif\n- War imposed on the khalif by rebels (rebellion)."},{"word":"khalifah","audio":"","script":"\u062e\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0647","grammar":"word;","meaning":"The Muslim Ummah's (nation\/peoples) Leadership.

It was transmitted to us in a chain starting from the Almighty Himself, to the angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammed (SAW). This message was given to the Prophet in pieces over a period spanning approximately 23 years (610 CE to 622 CE). The Prophet (SAW) was 40 years old when the Qur'an began to be revealed to him, and he was 63 when the revelation was completed. The language of the original message was Arabic, but it has been translated into many other languages.\n\nThe Qur'an is one leg of two which form the basis of Islam. The second leg is the Sunnah of the Prophet (SAW). What makes the Qur'an different from the Sunnah is primarily its form. Unlike the Sunnah, the Qur'an is quite literally the Word of Allah, whereas the Sunnah was inspired by Allah but the wording and actions are the Prophet's. The Qur'an has not been expressed using any human's words. Its wording is letter for letter fixed by no one but Allah.\n\nProphet Muhammed (SAW) was the final Messenger of Allah to humanity, and therefore the Qur'an is the last Message which Allah has sent to us. Its predecessors such as the Torah, Psalms, and Gospels have all been superceded.

Fasting during the Holy Islamic month of Ramadhan is one of the 5 pillars of Islam. Muslims fast every day in that month from dawn till dusk - effectively ~15 hours - and is not as difficult as people think. After dusk they can eat, drink and have relations.\nFasting is also done outside of this month and is considered a very good form of voluntary worship in devotion to God. A voluntary fast can last as many days as the person wills, but it must not fall on an eid day.","more":"Fasting isn't just refraining from food and drink. The purpose of fasting is more spiritual than physical and it is a means of devotion to God as well as self-discipline. Fasting purifies and trains the body and soul together. The Quran speaks about fasting: \n[2.183] O you who believe! fasting is prescribed for you, as it was prescribed for those before you, so that you may guard (against evil).\n[2.184] For a certain number of days; but whoever among you is sick or on a journey, then (he shall fast) a (like) number of other days; and those who are not able to do it may effect a redemption by feeding a poor man; so whoever does good spontaneously it is better for him; and that you fast is better for you if you know.\n[2.185] The month of Ramazan is that in which the Quran was revealed, a guidance to men and clear proofs of the guidance and the distinction; therefore whoever of you is present in the month, he shall fast therein, and whoever is sick or upon a journey, then (he shall fast) a (like) number of other days; Allah desires ease for you, and He does not desire for you difficulty, and (He desires) that you should complete the number and that you should exalt the greatness of Allah for His having guided you and that you may give thanks.\n[2.186] And when My servants ask you concerning Me, then surely I am very near; I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he calls on Me, so they should answer My call and believe in Me that they may walk in the right way.\n[2.187] It is made lawful to you to go unto your wives on the night of the fast; they are an apparel for you and you are an apparel for them; Allah knew that you acted unfaithfully to yourselves, so He has turned to you (mercifully) and removed from you (this burden); so now be in contact with them and seek what Allah has ordained for you, and eat and drink until the whiteness of the day becomes distinct from the blackness of the night at dawn, then complete the fast till night, and have not contact with them while you keep to the mosques; these are the limits of Allah, so do not go near them. Thus does Allah make clear His communications for men that they may guard (against evil).\n\nFasting in Ramadhan is obligatory for every adult male and female except those that will find it difficult like the old, the pregnant\/suckling\/menstruating woman, the ill, the mentally handicapped, and the traveller. Islam is a very considerate religion and fasting is easy. \nFasting is very good for the human body as well. It gives the stomach and other organs a rest and alters the blood sugar levels so that excess energy is depleted, and then later renewed. It makes the body lean and the mind open. Fasting is a healthy change to the eating patterns of humans and it is beneficial in many ways."},{"word":"sayed","audio":"","script":"\u0633\u064a\u062f","grammar":"word; title; name of male;","meaning":"(1) Sayed means Master or Mr (Mister).

Muhammed asked them 'If I said a large army is about to attack us, then would you believe me?', the people said yes, indeed you are most truthful - we know that you are one of the truthful ones.\n\nMuhammed then explained that there was no such army but he had something important to say, something much more important than an attacking army. Then he began to tell them about the principle beliefs of Islam, of his Prophethood and that he was a Messenger of God sent to stop the people from polytheism and to guide them to the path of the one and only God. The people listened attentively, but not all people took it lightly.\n\nAmong the crowd was his uncle Abu Lahab (Father of fire), so called because of his fiery anger and his reddish complexion, and he was very annoyed with what Muhammed had done. He said to Muhammed after listening to the initial few words the Prophet said, 'Is this what you called us out here for?!! May you perish\/be destroyed (Tabban laka)'.\n\nMuhammed was surprised by this response and remained silent. God was very angered by the insult and he sent these verses to Muhammed - \nIn the Name of Allah Most Gracious Most Merciful\n[111.1] Perdition (Tabbat) overtake both hands of Abu Lahab, and he will perish.\n[111.2] His wealth and what he earns will not avail him.\n[111.3] He shall soon burn in fire that flames,\n[111.4] And his wife, the bearer of fuel,\n[111.5] Upon her neck a halter of strongly twisted rope.\n\nAbu Lahab was an avowed enemy to Muhammed from the very beginning and so was his wife, hence the curse upon her too."},{"word":"tabeeb","audio":"","script":"\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0628","grammar":"word;","meaning":"A tabeeb is a doctor or physician.
